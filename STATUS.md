## Exact-count cluster assertions (the `v0.3.0` release blocker)

**PR [#744](https://github.com/pjunod/plurx/pull/744)
(`agent/exact-count-drill-accounting`) — built, verified, in review/CI.**

The two exact-count assertions that failed the `v0.3.0` cut (#736) on a
no-Rust-behaviour diff were investigated per the exact-count writeup,
evidence first:

- [x] Root cause proven: the learner drill's own `provider:artwork` lease
      heartbeat (production `acquire_cluster_job`, renew every 30s) commits
      one Raft entry per renewal; any compaction window slower than 30s is
      off by exactly one. Reproduced deterministically; the contaminating
      entry named down to its SQL.
- [x] §4.3 (watermark read appends per call) refuted by experiment — new
      `plurx-cluster-check -- watermark-experiment N` subcommand, 100 idle
      pairs, zero movement.
- [x] Fix, first round: the drill declares its renewing lease in
      `ForceCompaction` and subtracts the lease row's `revision` advance.
      Superseded by the SQL-class accounting below after the next CI run
      showed revision-invisible background entries; in every round the
      assertion stays `!=`, blank/membership entries stay hard failures, and
      nothing is absorbed into slack — tolerance exists only for entries
      attributed to a declared, named class.
- [x] Instrumentation (validation builds only): applied-entry counters by
      payload kind in vendored hiqlite + env-gated per-entry apply log
      (`PLURX_VALIDATION_LOG_APPLIED=1`); both exact-count windows print a
      full accounting line and name contaminating entries in their bails.
- [x] Adversarial review round: clippy blocker fixed; boundary sampling
      made consistent (retried until no entry commits mid-sample); experiment
      argument rejections tested.
- [x] Second background writer caught by the first post-fix CI run: the
      membership heartbeat (one `cluster_node_heartbeat_intents` transaction
      per node per round) plus failed lease-renewal CAS attempts, neither
      visible to the lease row's revision. Reworked to SQL-class accounting:
      applied normal entries are attributed to registered classes at apply
      time, windows declare which classes are legitimate, undeclared classes
      stay hard contamination, and the topology artifact records the
      tolerated count as `window_background_entries` (schema extended).
- [~] Verification: `make cluster-harness-check` green end to end; 10
      consecutive learner-drill runs green with the renewal accounted;
      full-suite run and PR CI in progress — merge follows green.
- [x] Topology's CI contaminant: attributed to the membership heartbeat
      class and tolerated by name; lease-class traffic there remains hard
      contamination, and any unclassified entry still fails with kinds and
      terms named.

**Decision made without Paul (flagged for review):** no change to
`docs/RELEASING.md`; the writeup's §7 suggestion (one cold-cache CI run
before the tag) is raised in the PR body for Paul to rule on.
