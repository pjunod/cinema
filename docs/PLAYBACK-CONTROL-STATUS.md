# Playback control rewrite — project status

**Updated:** 2026-08-27
**Merged baseline:** `origin/main` at `48ea494c` (PR #619)
**Current work:** [PR #621](https://github.com/pjunod/plurx/pull/621) on
`codex/playback-control-m4-deadline-cutoff` — review round 3 at exact head
`3827037aac069e5d212c5e1e2861f2461457bfbc` returned **REQUEST CHANGES**;
the repair implementation is committed at
`728abc86888c06fe7ebf420e06b6e5383b6f780a` and awaits exact-head round 4 before
any tests.
The action-passive actor deadline consumes the merged constant-space progress
proof and records one exact provisional due coordinate without starting a
recovery retry, killing, or replacing anything. Producer facts use the shared
transition-plus-ingress fence; exact physical hold/resume acknowledgements are
bounded ordered barriers that preserve preceding progress and wait before the
syscall when ingress is full. Lifecycle commands do not yet share the ingress
sequence, so terminal state revokes the non-production observation and the
legacy watchdog remains the only recovery action owner.
The detailed M4 contract is in
[`PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-M4-WATCHDOG-REMOVAL.md`](PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-M4-WATCHDOG-REMOVAL.md).
The resumable execution state is in
[`PLAYBACK-CONTROL-IMPLEMENTATION-HANDOFF.md`](PLAYBACK-CONTROL-IMPLEMENTATION-HANDOFF.md).
**Source of truth:** this page tracks delivery; the design and acceptance
contracts remain in
[`PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-PLAN.md`](PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-PLAN.md).

This is the canonical done-versus-left ledger for the playback-control
rewrite. Update it in every implementation PR. A feature listed as partial is
not being counted as complete merely because its foundation has landed.

## Active slice: M4 watchdog removal

PR #618 merged the complete M4 implementation contract at `f9cef83b`, after
seven adversarial passes and green local, cluster, and hosted gates. The actor
already owns explicit End, authority fence, and exact lease expiry; this slice
starts moving producer recovery evidence through that same owner.

M4 makes the same actor the sole recovery decision owner. It replaces hardware
startup grace, software startup/lifetime polling, and copy-segmenter fallback
with one exact-attempt `ProducerProgressDeadline`. One pre-publication retry is
allowed only when the actor supplies the validated recipe. After publication,
failure retains published bytes and produces one stable internal replacement
proposal; it never swaps the child in place or emits an incomplete wire action.
The existing exact-attempt supervisor remains the sole OS-child/PID owner, and
a single session executor orchestrates actor-authorized proxy changes. The full
contract is
[`PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-M4-WATCHDOG-REMOVAL.md`](PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-M4-WATCHDOG-REMOVAL.md).

Review and test state for M4:

| Gate | State |
|---|---|
| Implementation contract | **Merged in #618.** It defines deadline policy, contiguous cutoff-safe ingress with command and producer-event barriers, arm/disarm and event ordering, exhaustive action-timeout settlement, the one-retry invariant, hard rolling-process admission, process-executor ownership, publication-aware cleanup, post-publication proposal behavior, instrumentation, source ownership checks, and the race/failure matrix. |
| Static owner inventory | **Merged in #619.** `tests/playback/rolling-producer-owners.toml` exact-counts the known recovery/election/replacement owners and scans every Rust module under `plurxd/src`; the current branch adds the one named actor deadline while leaving every legacy count unchanged. |
| Progress ingress | **Merged in #619.** `ProgressCoverageBatch` retains first, covered tail/deadline, first gap, latest progress, and latest telemetry with a persistent exact-attempt watermark and exit barrier. The local actor consumes that proof without flattening away publication time. |
| Passive deadline/cutoff | **Round-3 repairs committed; not tested.** Producer facts fold once under transition plus ingress, use fenced publication timestamps, classify non-success exits immediately, preserve progress around bounded sequenced physical-flow barriers, fail closed when the actor/mailbox disappears, serialize actor-task exit fencing with producer transitions, and wait/re-authorize the exact attempt before a full-capacity STOP/CONT syscall. Duplicate pre-drain exits are coalesced and accounted, while stale flow revisions/attempts are rejected. The result remains provisional until command sequencing lands and emits no recovery action. |
| Operational projection | **Deferred, explicitly.** Armed deadline mode/coordinate, provisional due, process-exit due, flow revision, and physical-flow state remain actor-private and absent from lease snapshots, Activity/status, and Prometheus. Only `plurx_playback_rolling_producer_flow_deferrals_total` is exported. Add the bounded projection in the decision/action slice before watchdog removal. |
| Adversarial implementation review | **Request changes — round 3.** Exact head `3827037aac069e5d212c5e1e2861f2461457bfbc` found capacity-waiter liveness gaps on control/actor closure, an actor-task exit race after authorization/reservation but before the syscall, missing stale flow revision/attempt coverage, missing duplicate pre-drain exit accounting, and overclaimed capacity/reauthorization coverage. Commit `728abc86888c06fe7ebf420e06b6e5383b6f780a` adds fail-closed waiter wake/closed-mailbox checks, serializes actor-exit fencing with the producer transition mutex, reauthorizes the exact attempt, counts duplicate exits as coalesced before drain, adds stale-flow and process-level successor/retirement/cleanup/actor-abort regressions, and updates ownership counts. Exact-head round 4 is required before tests. |
| Unit/focused tests | **Not run for this slice.** Deterministic tests are authored, including stale revision/attempt and process-level successor, retirement, cleanup, and actor-abort regressions; they wait for exact-head round-4 adversarial approval. |
| Full/cluster/hosted gates | **Pending for this slice.** After approval: focused tests, `make check`, `make cluster-check`, hosted CI, then merge. |

## Watchdog-removal ledger

The target is not zero timers. The target is no overlapping recovery owners.
The detailed symbol-by-symbol contract is in the plan's
[deadline inventory](PLAYBACK-CONTROL-PROTOCOL-PLAN.md#7-deadlines-and-watchdog-inventory).

### Server mechanisms still present on merged `main`

| Mechanism | What it currently does | Removal owner |
|---|---|---|
| first-segment/software grace and progress watcher | Polls startup/progress and can replace or kill the encoder; it no longer needs to be the source of process-exit truth after M3c2 | M4 replaces this watcher with one actor-owned `ProducerProgressDeadline`; the exact-attempt process supervisor remains as event delivery, not a watchdog |
| `child_transition`, `watchdog_active`, `replacing_child` | Serializes and masks the old in-place replacement paths | M4 deletes them after every child event/action enters the actor |
| playlist and live-segment wait budgets | Bound an HTTP request waiting for publication | M3c1 records publication in actor state; later M3 routes waiters through it; bounded HTTP deadlines remain by design |
| 15-second repair/flow-control tick | Refreshes indexes, prunes retention, records speed, evaluates flow, and claims lease expiry | Scheduling remains; M3c1 copies publication/fetch facts into the actor but recovery decisions still move in M4 |
| `SegmentIndex`, `playlist_published`, `high_segment`, `fetched_end_ms` | Catalogs rolling files and feeds pruning, byte accounting, pacing, and status | M3c1 makes actor delivery state authoritative for status while retaining these as action-path compatibility projections until M4 |
| fetched-frontier ahead-window inference | Suspends/resumes production based on download behavior | M3b replaced the time policy only after a session enters explicit mode; legacy pacing and byte/disk safety remain |
| VOD segment materialization deadline | Bounds demand for an immutable segment that is not ready | Remains permanently as one of the three approved progress deadlines |

### Client recovery owners still present

| Client | Remaining independent recovery paths | Removal owner |
|---|---|---|
| Web | persistent-wait/startup/seek timers, hls.js fatal handlers, decode rescue, Auto rung replacement, truncated-end reopen, `/status` polling | M5 makes the controller the only action owner; M6 moves Auto to prepared actions; M9 deletes old polling |
| Apple | status polling, starvation/stall/black-frame monitors, reopen budgets/queue, early-end and item-failure handlers | Apple M2 reporter, then M5 controller cutover |
| Android | status polling, buffering stall tracker, stall guards/budgets, direct reopen coordinator, error/end compatibility handlers | Android M2 reporter, then M5 controller cutover |

After cutover, only these playback progress deadlines may remain:

1. server `ProducerProgressDeadline` for a producer that cannot report its own
   wedge or death;
2. client `PlaybackProgressDeadline` because only the playback framework knows
   whether decoded media is rendering; and
3. VOD `SegmentMaterializationDeadline` because an HTTP request cannot wait
   forever for a demanded immutable object.

Lease expiry, cluster owner expiry, preparation expiry, retirement grace,
HTTP/relay limits, admission waits, and control rate windows also remain, but
they are named lifecycle/network bounds rather than competing playback
recovery watchdogs.

The 60-second terminal-ack retention window introduced by M3c3 is likewise an
idempotency bound: it retains one immutable accepted reply and triggers no
playback, replacement, restart, or failure decision. It is not a watchdog.

## Remaining delivery order

1. Complete M4 and prove the old server watchdog/replacement symbols are gone.
2. Complete Apple and Android M2 reporters and record timer/alternate-ingress
   behavior.
3. Complete M5/M5.5/M6 so quality, codec, dynamic range, tracks, subtitles, and
   node placement use the same prepare/commit/abort transaction.
4. Complete semantic indexing: exact intro/credits destinations with
   provenance/confidence, manual overrides, subtitle readiness, queue metrics,
   and marker-destination prewarm.
5. Complete clustered planned/hard handoff, mixed-fleet cutover, compatibility
   deletion, playback-lab fault injection, and physical web/Apple/Android
   acceptance.

## Definition of finished

This project is finished only when M9 acceptance passes: repository checks
find only the three approved progress deadlines and named lifecycle timers;
no recovery path outside the actor/controller can replace media; transparent
prepared handoffs cover the supported recipe axes and cluster ownership;
semantic analysis publishes exact skip destinations; and the automated plus
physical playback matrices are green. Merged foundations are not a substitute
for that exit condition.
