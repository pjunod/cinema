# HDHomeRun Live TV status — what is built and what is proved

**Status:** M2 qualified, publishing · **Effort:** `effort/hdhomerun-live-tv` ·
**Updated:** 2026-09-04 · **Historical issue:**
[#902](https://github.com/pjunod/plurx/issues/902)

Companion to [HDHOMERUN-LIVE-TV-PLAN.md](HDHOMERUN-LIVE-TV-PLAN.md) (the
contract and ordered work) and [DEVELOPMENT_PIPELINE.md](DEVELOPMENT_PIPELINE.md)
(the task-PR and final qualification rules) — this is the one-page answer to
*where is the effort, what passed, and what decision was made without Paul?*

## Progress — task PRs earn their checkmark

| Milestone | State | PR | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 plan and adversarial review | merged | [#904](https://github.com/pjunod/plurx/pull/904) | review approved; effort gate passed; merge `e3f05f2e` |
| M1 device/settings/lineup | merged | [#906](https://github.com/pjunod/plurx/pull/906) | attack-review findings fixed; re-review approved; effort gate passed; merge `b15d241a` |
| M2 live HLS and cluster relay | qualified; publishing | pending Forgejo PR | Rust 1.97.1 workspace check/clippy, no-default compile, 22 Live TV, 2 route-matrix, and 2 foreground-admission tests pass at `dd528728` |

## Current work — qualify and review M2

M0 and M1 are merged to the effort. M2 now has the always-compiled foreground
admission path, one-open tuner-to-FFmpeg pump, bounded six-segment live HLS
scratch, owner-bound capabilities, provisional-start activation, signed
cluster relay/control, serving and settings-generation fences, idle/progress
timeouts, activity, and metrics. Playback remains runtime-disabled until an
administrator follows the safety checklist in Settings → Developer; there is
no Cargo feature or build variant to unlock.

The exact source-only Rust 1.97.1 loop passes. Next is the Forgejo task PR,
effort gate, exact-diff adversarial review, fixes, re-review, and merge.
Forgejo is the only mutable remote after the repository migration; its
deploy-key authorization is currently the publishing blocker, not an
implementation blocker.

## Decisions made while the owner is away

| Decision | Why | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|
| One manually configured private IPv4 device | Docker/VLAN broadcast discovery cannot be promised from the data-plane namespace | a diagnostic discovery helper can prove its namespace and interfaces |
| One explicit tuner-owner node with signed relay | prevents four cluster nodes from advertising sixteen leases on four tuners | replicated fenced tuner leases exist |
| Default two concurrent sessions | FLEX/CONNECT 4K has only two ATSC 3-capable tuners and other clients may compete | hardware evidence supports a different household policy |
| H.264/AAC at 720p by default | broad client compatibility and realistic realtime encoding | 1080p/2160p fixtures pass on the selected owner |
| Runtime enablement only; no code feature gate | one binary must expose the same capability everywhere while unsafe activation stays explicit and reversible | never; this is the product contract |
| One tuner HTTP GET and one FFmpeg process per session | retries can double-lease physical tuners and split lifecycle ownership | a device-native resumable lease protocol exists |
| DRM and captions unsupported | plurx has no licensed DRM path; captions lack end-to-end proof | a lawful DRM path or 608/708 fixture exists |
| All first-party clients are in scope | a living-room feature is not complete as a web-only API | owner explicitly narrows the product surface |

## Known limits — honest until evidence changes them

- HDHomeRun HTTP behavior differs by model and firmware; the hardware pass
  must record `discover.json`, sanitized lineup facts, headers, and FFmpeg
  result from the actual device.
- ATSC 3.0 commonly needs HEVC and AC-4. Device reception does not prove the
  installed FFmpeg can decode either.
- Owner failure ends the current live session. The next Watch may start after
  the owner returns or the configured owner changes; automatic takeover is not
  part of this effort.
- An external HDHomeRun client can win a tuner after plurx checks capacity.
  Runtime `503` remains normal and actionable.
